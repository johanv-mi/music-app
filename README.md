# Music App

#### A simple playlist app that fetches songs from a json file and saves your playlist to local storage

This project is a part of the course Arbetsmetodik at Medieinstitutet's FrontEnd Development program.

The app fetches artists, songs, and genres from a mocked database in a .json file and the user is able to sort by genre to create a playlist. The playlist can then be saved to local storage if the user so chooses.

Written in vanilla JS, CSS and HTML
